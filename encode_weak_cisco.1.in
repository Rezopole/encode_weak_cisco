.SH NAME
encode_weak_cisco \- encode some data using the old, reversible, cisco way ; that's nice for anssible because it is predictable.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B encode_weak_cisco
.RI "[" --salt=XXXX "] [" --help "] [ ... " data_to_encode " ... ]"

for each data given by parameters
.B encode_weak_cisco
encodes with Cisco reversible encoding algorithm, using either the supplied salt (for reproductible results) or using a randomly generated salt.

If real strong security is needed, one should not use this tool : this encoding is
.I reversible
and any passphrase could be decyphered very easily.

The only reason for using this cypher is in order get a workaround for tools that may compare uploaded configurations with locally generated configurations ; using a fully predictable encoding prevent from endlessly uploading the configuration whereas other cyphers would change any passphrase at every iteration.
